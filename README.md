# Apartment Manager

This project made go insane for the last 8 days. Here is what I made with what I learned.

Firstly I created 2 seperate site for the admin and user side. As a admin I decided that I need to be able to change and see all users without restriction. 
Also admin has to be able to delete and send announcements to all users.

#### Here we glance at the glorious home page of admin page. We can easily delete and add new announcements to share with all the residents.

#### We can see the list part of the admin page. Admins can see all the residants including non-users(like childs and elders or anyone who resides in the flat but doesnt access the site)  
#### From this page admins can delete or alter a users data with ease. Update button takes admins to update page where all the info that user has is pre-registered.

#### This is the registration page. Admins can add new user or non-user from here.

#### This page is admin transaction page. From this forms admins can add dues to all flats and post a new announcement to let users know that a new expense or due has been added
#### At the second part admins can alter a flats debt value. This gives admins the ability to manually handle money transactions if something goes wrong

#### At this page admin can easily choose the flat they want to see from the dropdown menu on the navigation bar.
#### This page automatically sets parameters according to dropdown menu and shows correct flat

# I HAVEN'T FINISHED YET

Next is the user side of the things so its fairly simple. User page pretty much identical when it comes to looks but feature wise everything is there.

#### This is the home page of the user page. In here there isnt much to do but we can see all the announcements that admins sent.

#### This is the users info page. From here a user can see all the information they have about their flat.

#### This page is special to the current user and they can alter their information on the database without admins help.
#### Also all the required places are pre-registered so that changing something is extremely easy.

#### As everyone can see this is the transaction page for users. A user can check their debt and easily pay their debts exactly.
